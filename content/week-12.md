Alex Walkman is the CEO at ARTLOOK STUDIOS. The reason why I want to connect with him is that I really like the style of videos they produced. Also, the studio is located at Brooklyn. So it's quite possible that I would be able to connect with him and talk about some potential opportunities.

James Troici is a freelance video editor at Sorrentino Media. I want to connect with him because he seems to have a similar career path as mine. He did some amazing video projects while he was in college. And after that, he was hired as a freelancer by a company. He might give me some suggestions in terms of freelancing work.

Max Gieser is a freelancer too. But instead of being hired by a company, he works as a "total freelancer". This makes me very interested because I would like to know more about he to set up a full freelancing service for a client.
