### Cover Letter
Dear Hiring Manager,

My name is Leo. I’m currently a senior student major in Integrated Digital Media at NYU. I’ve been a huge fan of MKBHD since 2016. And congratulations on moving into the new studio! Super excited to see how it looks like after you fully move in. I’m writing to see if you have any plans hiring more people in the future. And I’m happy to be part of it.

I'm a filmmaker, videographer and video editor in New York City. I've worked as a videographer/editor at NYU Tandon School of Engineering and Pear Video, a short video platform in China. In the past few years, I've developed proficiency in Davinci Resolve Studio, Adobe Premiere Pro and Final Cut Pro X. Also, I'm experienced in operating both digital cinema cameras (BMPCC 4K) and mirrorless cameras (SONY a7 III). Beyond those technical skills, I truly enjoy the process of creating content and believe good content has real impact on people.

My resume is attached. My work can be found at https://www.lihaowang.work/videos. Please feel free to email me at lihao.wang@nyu.edu or call me at 302-883-4522.

Thank you for your consideration. If you don’t have any recruitment plan right now, feel free to contact me anytime in the future. I hope to hear from you soon.

Best,
Leo
