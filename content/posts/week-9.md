# Changes I made
* I organized all the projects into categories: Videos, Photography, Web, Graphic Design. So it's easier for recruiters to navigate.
* For the video projects, instead of just showing the video itself, I added three small thumbnails beneath. So if the someone doesn't want to watch the whole video, he or she could get an overview of the video.
* I changed the layout of the homepage. I added an animation photo of mine, also the titles I have. I also wrote a breif intro of myself. So the recruiters can quickly have an understanding of who am I.
