## changes to the portfolio website
There isn't much to change about the website. I updated my intro on the landing page. Instead of using "I", I use "He" to make it more professional. 

## changes to the resume
I removed the "school projects" part, which containes the web dev projects I did. So the resume is clearer to the video related jobs I'm applying to.
