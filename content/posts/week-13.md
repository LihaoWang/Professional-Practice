##  write about one takeaway or piece of advice a speaker gave that you agree with—write about why it resonated with you and how you think it applies to your career journey going forward.

I think one advice from Kasia is really helpful: know your strength and weakness while applying to jobs. It is very inspiring because I realized that I have to know myself before applying to jobs. If I didn't know my strength and weakness in the first place, I cannot apply to jobs stragiticly.

## write about one takeaway or piece of advice a speaker gave that you disagree with—write about why you didn't agree and offer up an alternative suggestion. 

I disagree with De Angela's opinion on cover letter. I don't think we should pay too much attention to cover letter. If we had to write a new cover letter everytime when applying to a new job, we wouldn't be able to apply to jobs efficiently. And most of the companies won't even look at my resume, not to speak of cover letter.
