## Rose: What was your most positive experience or takeaway from this class this semester?
This class gave me an overview of what career planning is like, including preparing for entering into the job market, writing cover letter, etc. I got a lot of valuable advice from you and the guest speakers. For example, knowing your strength and weakness, creating your own filter, don't limit yourself to one direction, etc.


## Bud: What is something you're feeling hopeful about in relation to the things we've talked about this semester?
Knowing that the career doesn't have to be a straight line is hopeful for me. I do have a lot of interests want to try out. So I could be confident spending a few years exploring my career path. 


## Thorn: What was a challenge this class presented to you this semester? (Go beyond just "Coronavirus").
I think one of the challenges is that conencting with people. Because at first I was a little bit nervous when trying to approach strangers. And during the class, I had to go on LinkedIn and look for people to connect with and possibly make conversation.
