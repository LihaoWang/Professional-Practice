### Revise your pitch
Hello, my name is Leo. I’m a senior student major in Integrated Digital Media at New York University. I started filmmaking back I was in high school and I’m always passionate about it. In the past few years, I have developed proficiency in videography, video editing, and color grading. I enjoy capturing beautiful stories and edit them into great videos. I won’t put a limit on myself so I’m constantly experimenting with new things. 

Currently, I’m working as a videographer and editor at NYU Tandon Marketing and Communications department. Here I’ve learned how to work in a professional way, communicate with different people in a big team and adjust the content to the audience. Last semester, I produced a documentary that celebrates the 50th anniversary of the Apollo 11 Moon Landing. I combined interviews with two professors who worked on the lunar module project, archival footage from NASA and still images to tell a cohesive story. The videos I produced were used on the NYU Tandon website, reaching both enrolled students and students who are interesting in applying. 

Since I am graduating this May. I would like to work in a more professional environment and work with talented people to create better content.

### Find 3 job descriptions
I searched video editor positions on LinkedIn. Most job description mentions group work, technical requirements (software) and reel. For senior level positions, all of them require 3+ years of experience. And some high-end companies have film degree bachelor requirement. 
I think junior level editor position is more approachable for me. Also, I need to have a good reel to get the position. 

### Research 4-5 different people
I searched people with video editor title on LinkedIn. I found that almost everyone is doing freelance work whether or not he or she has a full-time job. And most of them have bachelor degree in film studies or film production. Interestingly, among the people I researched, none of them has a master degree. All of them have a reel and have a few experience in filmmaking area. And there's one person has the experience of being a sales person at B&H.

### Read chapter 2 in Designing Your Life. Answer the questions and post them to your blog.
For me, work means the way of sustaining my life. But at the same time, work shouldn’t be something that I hate doing. It should be something that sparks my joy and interests me. I enjoy challenging myself, so I’m ok if the work is outside of my comfort zone. I would like to do the work that is creative instead of repetitive. In my opinion, the work I produced should add value to the society or help make the life better. Money isn’t a big part of work as long as I can sustain my life with the salary. At the beginning of my career, I tend to be humble. Getting more experience and personal growth are more important than how much I get paid. 

I’m here on this planet because the evolution of human being. I’m lucky enough to have a chance to live and enjoy every moment here. In my opinion, life itself doesn’t have any meaning. What makes it meaningful is how we spend every day of our life. Every individual is unique in the universe. Family and country are just different levels of categorization that group people together. There’s no absolute definition of good or evil. But in general, good is what adds value to the society while evil is what tears the society apart. I think the joy, sorrow, justice, etc is what makes human beings unique. The ability to have different emotion reacting to different situations is what differs us from robots. 

I found that I want to do the work that adds value to the society, which aligns with my Lifeview. However, I think the work is the way of sustaining my life but also want to work for fulfillment. This is a little inconsistent.
