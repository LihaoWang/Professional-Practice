For me, work means the way of sustaining my life. But at the same time, work shouldn’t be something that I hate doing. It should be something that sparks my joy and interests me. I enjoy challenging myself, so I’m ok if the work is outside of my comfort zone. I would like to do the work that is creative instead of repetitive. In my opinion, the work I produced should add value to the society or help make the life better. Money isn’t a big part of work as long as I can sustain my life with the salary. At the beginning of my career, I tend to be humble. Getting more experience and personal growth are more important than how much I get paid. 

I’m here on this planet because the evolution of human being. I’m lucky enough to have a chance to live and enjoy every moment here. In my opinion, life itself doesn’t have any meaning. What makes it meaningful is how we spend every day of our life. Every individual is unique in the universe. Family and country are just different levels of categorization that group people together. There’s no absolute definition of good or evil. But in general, good is what adds value to the society while evil is what tears the society apart. I think the joy, sorrow, justice, etc is what makes human beings unique. The ability to have different emotion reacting to different situations is what differs us from robots. 

I found that I want to do the work that adds value to the society, which aligns with my Lifeview. However, I think the work is the way of sustaining my life but also want to work for fulfillment. This is a little inconsistent.
