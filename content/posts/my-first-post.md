I consider myself in good physical health, no major disease. But I gained some weight recently because of unhealthy diet. I wish I could exercise more regularly. In terms of mental health, I would get stressed very easily. So I have to continue working on my ability to deal with stress.

I feel like I'm addicted to work. I would feel guilty if I'm not working. 

I often ignore the play part in my life. I think it is unnecessary because it doesn't have any visible outcome. 

My major source of love comes from my parents. They care about me so much and always support me. I'm very thankful to them as well. Another part of love is my friends. I have a few friends that I can talk to openly and honestly. I also treat them sincerely and thankfully. 

I think I didn't pay enough attention to the play part of my life. I'd like to tackle tis problem and live a more balanced life.

I don't think it's a gravity problem because it isn't the type of thing that I have to accept. The possible solution could be dedicate less time on working and more on playing. Also, I could find something that interests me and do it for fun. In this way, I won't focus too much on working.
